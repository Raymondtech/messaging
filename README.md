## Usage

### To Get Started

Start by reading the [Installing Plugins](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/installing-regular-plugins-on-wpmu/) section in our comprehensive [WordPress and WordPress Multisite Manual](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/) if you are new to WordPress. Login to your admin panel and activate the plugin:

*   On regular WordPress installs – visit Plugins and Activate the plugin.
*   For WordPress Multisite installs – visit Network Admin -> Plugins and Network Activate the plugin.

Once installed and activated, you'll see a new menu item in your dashboard: Inbox.

*   When activated on Multisite installs, the "Messaging Settings" item in the screenshot below will not be seen on subsites, it instead resides inside the Network Dashboard under Settings -> Messaging.

### Using Messaging

When your users go to the "Inbox" page on their Dashboards, they'll see a page like this: 

![Messaging Menu for User](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/messaging-1166-messaging-menu.png)

 From there, they can send each other messages by clicking on "New Message". When composing a message to another user, the "To (usernames)" field will allow your users to search for other users on the site by typing in the name, email address or username of the other user (it will search and display users that match what's been typed into the field): 

![Write New Message](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/messaging-1166-new-message.png)

 Once the message has been sent, the user(s) that the message was sent to will receive an email notification: 

![Email Notification](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/messaging-1166-email-notification.png)

 Should a user not want to receive email notifications of new messages, he can go to Inbox -> Notifications, and disable them from there: 

![Notification Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/messaging-1166-notification-settings.png)

 When a user logs in to his Dashboard, and goes to his Inbox, the message that was sent to him will show up in the "Unread" section there: 

![Viewing unread messages](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/messaging-1166-unread-messages-inbox.png)

 From there, he can choose to read the message: 

![Reading sent message](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/messaging-1166-reading-message.png)

 Reply to it: 

![Reading sent message](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/messaging-1166-replying-to-message.png)

 Or remove the message from his inbox. :)

### Configuring Messaging

You can go to Inbox -> Messaging Settings to configure the notification email that gets sent to users when a message is sent to them.

*   On Multisite, you'd need to go to Settings -> Messaging inside of the Network Dashboard to do this. :)
